# Authentication

All requests to the public API must be authenticated using your organizations API token.

## Getting an API token

To get an API token for your organization please get in touch with your Account Manager.

## Using an API token

The API token must be provided as a bearer token in the authorization header:

```txt
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN
```

## Invalidating an API token

In case your API token needs to be invalidated, because it was exposed in source control repositories, logs or for other reasons, please get in touch with your Account Manager.
